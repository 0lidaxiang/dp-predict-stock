# dp-predict-stock
This is the final project of NTUST CS5144701  Practices of Deep Learning course.  
Used re-constructed news title data to predict stock by deep learning(LSTM).

And this projectâ€˜goal is to improve the performance of [this paper](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/329.pdf)'s
result.That paper uses the CNN neural network.

## Used Technology & Library
+ [Reverb](http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/README.html)  
+ [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)  
+ [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)    
+ [Stanford-OpenIE-Python](https://github.com/philipperemy/Stanford-OpenIE-Python)  

**How to Use reverb**  
Go to the website [Reverb](http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/README.html) and download jar file.  
Prepare the newsdata.txt file. And run this comamnd:
```
java -Xmx512m -jar ./test_reverb/reverb.jar reverb_pre.txt reverb_result.txt
```

## Dataset
This [financial-news-dataset](https://github.com/philipperemy/financial-news-dataset) is from Bloomberg and Reuters, including 450,341 news from Bloomberg and 109,110 news from Reuters.

Stock data is from  this api website - [alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co).

## Progress
1. [x] Decide using which dataset, including stock data and news data (2018-05-20).
2. [x] To know how to use reverb to split one news title sentence (2018-05-25).
3. [x] Process the news data: got the title and time (2018-05-27).
4. [x] Process the stock data: got the price (2018-05-28).

5. [x] Reconstruct the stock price data, only save the result that compared with last day price.If today's price is smaller than last days, it will be saved on 0 and other situation will be saved on 1 (2018-05-29).

6. [x] Using the Reverb technology to split a news title sentence of all news's data to the three part format (2018-05-29).

7. [x] Generate the word_embedding model, using reverb-result  (2018-05-30).
8. [ ] Generate embedding_matrix, using Keras's tool (2018-05-30).
9. [ ] Construct the neural network model(Event-LSTM) (2018-05-30).
10. [ ] Train and predict (2018-05-31).
11. [ ] If the predict's result dont bigger than 65%, to find and modify the errors (2018-06-01).
12. [ ] Generate the final project documents and slides  (2018-06-18).
