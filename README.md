# dp-predict-stock
This is the final project of NTUST CS5144701  Practices of Deep Learning course.  
Used re-constructed news title data to predict stock by deep learning(LSTM).

And this projectâ€˜goal is to improve the performance of [this paper](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/329.pdf)'s
result.That paper uses the CNN neural network.
